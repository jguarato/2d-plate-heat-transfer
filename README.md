## Solving the 2D flat plate heat transfer problem

☑️ The numerical solution of the two dimensional heat equation is obtained by using the Finite Difference Method (FDM).

Three codes are available here:
<li> Plate2D_SteadyState: solve the problem in steady-state;</li>
<li> Plate2D_TransientExplicit: solve the problem in transient regime using the exlicit scheme;</li>
<li> Plate2D_TransientImplicit: solve the problem in transient regime using the implicit scheme.</li>

👩🏻‍🎓 These codes were developed during my undergraduate studies.
