# 2D flat plate heat transfer problem

Here, three codes are available, they were developed to solve the 2D flat plate heat transfer problem using the finite differences method:
<li> Plate2D_SteadyState: solve the problem in steady-state;</li>
<li> Plate2D_TransientExplicit: solve the problem in transient regime using the exlicit scheme;</li>
<li> Plate2D_TransientImplicit: solve the problem in transient regime using the implicit scheme.</li>

<hr>

These codes were developed during my undergraduate studies.
