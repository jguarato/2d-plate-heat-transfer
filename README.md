# 2D flat plate heat transfer problem

<p> Here, three codes - developed in MATLAB to solve the 2D flat plate heat transfer problem using the finite difference method - are available:</p>

<li> Plate2D_SteadyState: solve the problem in steady-state;</li>
<li> Plate2D_TransientExplicit: solve the problem in transient regime using the exlicit scheme;</li>
<li> Plate2D_TransientImplicit: solve the problem in transient regime using the implicit scheme.</li>

<p> These codes were developed during my undergraduate studies. </p>
